Core Data behaves strangely when doing fetch requests using predicates with array operators against objects with pending (unsaved) changes.

This project attempts to reproduce this strange behavior.

The interesting code is in applicationDidFinishLaunching: in AppDelegate.m

Note: The data store is recreated on every launch of the application.
